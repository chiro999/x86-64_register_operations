# x86-64_special_registers
## This code snippet demonstrates the use various registers and Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) registers available in the x86 architecture over the years
#AL (Accumulator Low):

    AL is the lower 8 bits (byte) of the AX register.
    It's the least significant byte of AX.

#AH (Accumulator High):

    AH is the upper 8 bits (byte) of the AX register.
    It's the most significant byte of AX.

#AX, EAX, RAX:

    These are general-purpose registers in the x86 architecture, used for various data manipulation tasks.
    AX: The 16-bit version.
    EAX: The 32-bit version.
    RAX: The 64-bit version.
    They are often used for arithmetic operations, memory addressing, and other general computations.

#XMM Registers:

    These are SIMD registers introduced with SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) for multimedia and floating-point operations.
    XMM registers are 128 bits wide and can hold different data types, such as single-precision floating-point numbers, integers, and packed data.
    They are used for parallel processing of multiple data elements within a single instruction.
    Commonly used for multimedia applications and some scientific computing tasks.

#YMM Registers:

    Introduced with AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions), YMM registers are 256 bits wide and extend the capabilities of XMM registers.
    They offer increased parallelism by allowing operations on larger data sets compared to XMM registers.
    Used for more advanced multimedia, scientific computing, and other tasks requiring higher parallelism.

#ZMM Registers:

    Exclusive to Intel CPU's from Skylake-X(HEDT) and beyond.Recently became available on Ryzen 7000. 
    Introduced with AVX-512, ZMM registers are 512 bits wide and further extend the SIMD capabilities.
    ZMM registers offer even higher parallelism and are used in high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and scientific simulations.
    AVX-512 introduces new instructions and data types optimized for these registers.
